# Gesture-Vocalizer
Gesture Vocalizer provides information about the way in which the people with speech and hearing impairment will communicate with each other and daily people through a device that will overcome most of the difficulties being found. The device converts hand gestures (sign language) to audio signals and text output.

Sign language cannot be understood by normal people, so it creates barrier in communication between normal people and mute and deaf people. Hence there must a midway that would convert this gestures into text and speech format, so normal people would understand it. In this project, we used two sensors, flex sensor and accelerometer which is mounted on gloves. Flex sensor is used to measure bending of fingers. Accelerometer is use to measure static and dynamic acceleration.Other components used are Atemga328p microcontroller and speech synthesizer.
